## Link Roundup

[@geekygirlsarah](http://twitter.com/geekygirlsarah) wrote up what she learned from #SpeakerConfessions [[read it](https://geekygirlsarah.com/2017/07/28/what-i-learned-from-co-starting-speakerconfessions/)][tweet it]. We're not surprised to see so much about nerves and anxiety - but always heartened to see people supporting each other! [@designatednerd](http://twitter.com/designatednerd) wrote up a whole thread of #SpeakerConfessions [[read it](https://twitter.com/designatednerd/status/891306878436814848)].

Helpful observation from [@housecor](http://twitter.comhousecor) [[read it](https://twitter.com/housecor/status/891629593664401408)] - "A conference speaker's primary impact isn't teaching...It's getting you excited enough to learn more."

It may be understated, but the simple act of using stock photos of underrepresented people could make a difference. To help change perceptions about the tech industry and help women and people of color envision their career potential. This post from [@betterallies](https://twitter.com/betterallies) has two great (and free) resources for finding stock photography of underrepresented folks for your next presentation.

## Inspiration

We're inspired by Sally Yates' Harvard Commencement speech. Notice how she returned to a reference from the start at the end, and how she ties the lessons she shares to her own story - and makes them relatable [[read it](http://time.com/4793996/sally-yates-harvard-law-school-2017-graduation-speech/)][tweet it]. The ending paints a picture we can all aspire to, "They are individuals who recognize that while the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice, it doesn’t bend that way on its own."
