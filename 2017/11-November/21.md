# Edition ?

**There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. If Technically Speaking has helped you as a speaker, we'd love it if you shared that story on [the wiki](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/wiki).**

This week we have `what`

## Link Roundup

If you're a white man attending an event focused on diversity... don't be that guy. Important story from [@audreylouisa](http://twitter.com/audreylouisa) on owning privilidge - but not actually wanting to help [[read it](https://blog.usejournal.com/why-i-walked-away-from-a-tech-diversity-event-crying-over-a-white-man-e98c41dbccae)][tweet it].

Helpful article from [@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) on the difference between talk slides and presentation slides [[read it](https://medium.com/@wiredferret/talk-slides-are-not-a-presentation-deck-3d560a6e7426)][tweet it]. We could not agree more with putting your twitter handle on every slide! Do it!


## Inspiration

We loved this story from [@lrnrd](http://twitter.com/lrnrd) about rediscovering and recommiting to community [[read it](http://wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2017/11/17/on-community/)][tweet it]. This is the best outcome from an event, and we're grateful and inspired by the reminder.
