# Edition ?

**There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. If Technically Speaking has helped you as a speaker, we'd love it if you shared that story on [the wiki](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/wiki).**
