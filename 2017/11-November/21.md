# Edition 143

**There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. If Technically Speaking has helped you as a speaker, we'd love it if you shared that story on [the wiki](https://github.com/catehstn/technically-speaking/wiki).**

This week we have community - rediscovering it and lifting others up. Power and some ideas of how to use it, and a whirlwind first year public speaking.

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Bangalore, where Cate was speaking at [@tryswiftindia](http://twitter.com/tryswiftindia).

## Link Roundup

If you're a white man attending an event focused on diversity... don't be that guy. Important story from [@audreylouisa](http://twitter.com/audreylouisa) on owning privilidge - but not actually wanting to help [[read it](https://blog.usejournal.com/why-i-walked-away-from-a-tech-diversity-event-crying-over-a-white-man-e98c41dbccae)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20walked%20away%20from%20a%20tech%20%2B%20diversity%20event%20crying%20over%20a%20white%20man%20by%20%40audreylouisa%20https%3A//blog.usejournal.com/why-i-walked-away-from-a-tech-diversity-event-crying-over-a-white-man-e98c41dbccae%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

Helpful article from [@wiredferret](http://twitter.com/wiredferret) on the difference between talk slides and presentation slides [[read it](https://medium.com/@wiredferret/talk-slides-are-not-a-presentation-deck-3d560a6e7426)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Talk%20slides%20are%20not%20a%20presentation%20deck%20%E2%80%93%20Heidi%20Waterhouse%20by%20%40wiredferret%20https%3A//medium.com/%40wiredferret/talk-slides-are-not-a-presentation-deck-3d560a6e7426%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We could not agree more with putting your twitter handle on every slide! Do it!

On the theme of community and lifting others up, this article is about athletics but applies more generally [[read it](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/opinion/sunday/shalane-flanagan-marathon-running.html?_r=0)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20the%20%E2%80%98Shalane%20Flanagan%20Effect%E2%80%99%20Works%20-%20The%20New%20York%20Times%20https%3A//www.nytimes.com/2017/11/11/opinion/sunday/shalane-flanagan-marathon-running.html%3F_r%3D0%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. We couldn't agree more with this quote, "Elevating other women is actually an act of self-interest: Itâ€™s not so lonely at the top if you bring others along."

This thread from [@nitya](http://twitter.com/nitya) really captures what we've been aiming for with Technically Speaking [[read it](https://twitter.com/nitya/status/927863761519640578)] - thank you.

Helpful list of requirements for speaking from [@sehurlburt](http://twitter.com/sehurlburt) [[read it](https://twitter.com/sehurlburt/status/899400813130285056)]. She's right - established speakers do have power, use it!  

Wow [@rkoutnik](http://twitter.com/rkoutnik)'s first year of public speaking sounds like quite the whirlwind [[read it](https://twitter.com/rkoutnik/status/900810267507933184)].

## Inspiration

We loved this story from [@lrnrd](http://twitter.com/lrnrd) about rediscovering and recommiting to community [[read it](http://wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2017/11/17/on-community/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20community%20%E2%80%93%20very%20much%20alive.%20by%20%40lrnrd%20http%3A//wunder.schoenaberselten.com/2017/11/17/on-community/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. This is the best outcome from an event, and we're grateful and inspired by the reminder.
