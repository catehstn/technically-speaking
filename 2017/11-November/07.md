# Edition 142

**There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you.**

This week we have a public speaking journey, what to do after the rejection, and how to use that pause.

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from San Francisco where Chiu-Ki is attending
[@KotlinConf](https://twitter.com/KotlinConf) and [@DroidconSF](https://twitter.com/DroidconSF).

Our upcoming talks: Cate is speaking at [@tryswiftindia](http://twitter.com/tryswiftindia) in November.

## Link Roundup

[@marianeum](https://twitter.com/marianeum) shares her public speaking journey. She was under-prepared for her first talk and feeling super nervous. For her second talk, she went through speaker training. She was still very nervous, but it felt manageable. Lots of great tips in her post [[read it](https://medium.com/a-problem-like-maria/a-problem-like-public-speaking-3859b20b2d00)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=How%20%40marianeum%20overcome%20her%20fear%20of%20public%20speaking%20https%3A//medium.com/a-problem-like-maria/a-problem-like-public-speaking-3859b20b2d00%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]!

Great talk on public speaking from [@piwai](https://twitter.com/piwai), starting from the basics like how to come up with talk ideas and how to collect material, to advanced techniques like magic move in Keynote [[watch it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5HYGu_UBNo)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Tech%20Talks%20for%20Humans%20by%20%40piwai%20https%3A//www.youtube.com/watch?v=d5HYGu_UBNo%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

There are _tons_ of resources out there for what to do after a speaker-hopeful's conference talk proposal gets accepted, but what do speaker-hopefuls do after their talk proposal gets rejected? [@alainakafkes](https://twitter.com/alainakafkes) shares the steps she took to turn rejections into revisions to provide people who want to speak at conferences with actions that they can take to improve their talk proposals [[read it](https://dev.to/alainakafkes/rejection--revision-on-improving-conference-proposals-3fk)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Rejection%20%26%20Revision%3A%20On%20Improving%20Conference%20Proposals%20by%20%40alainakafkes%20https%3A//dev.to/alainakafkes/rejection--revision-on-improving-conference-proposals-3fk%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

## Inspiration

We're always inspired by Rep. Maxine Waters, and loved this from her [[watch it](https://twitter.com/nowthisnews/status/914226364374323200)]. It's about not just encouraging others to do the work, but doing the work yourself.
