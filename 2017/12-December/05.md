## Link Roundup

A systematic break-down on why [#paytospeak](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23paytospeak) is harmful. We love how [@Tweet_Cassandra](https://twitter.com/Tweet_Cassandra) lays out her reason, plus point-by-point rebuttal on the counter arguments. The section on Diversity, Privilege and the Elite echoes our philosophy on why we only include CFPs which try to cover travel costs [[read it](http://www.cassandrahl.com/blog/why-i-dont-pay-to-speak/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Pay%20to%20Speak%20by%20%40Tweet_Cassandra%20http%3A//www.cassandrahl.com/blog/why-i-dont-pay-to-speak/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].
