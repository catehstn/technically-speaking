# Edition 144

`personal intro`

This week we have `what`

Thanks to our sustaining sponsor [@Glowforge](http://twitter.com/glowforge). Cate is an advisor and [loves them so much](https://cate.blog/2015/10/21/lasers-and-practical-skills/) she's helped place 6 employees to them. And guess what... you could [work with them too](https://glowforge.com/jobs/)!  

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Nashville, Tennessee, where Cate has been attending [@WordCampUS](http://twitter.com/WordCampUS) and SF.

## Link Roundup

A systematic break-down on why [#paytospeak](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23paytospeak) is harmful. We love how [@Tweet_Cassandra](https://twitter.com/Tweet_Cassandra) lays out her reason, plus point-by-point rebuttal on the counter arguments. The section on Diversity, Privilege and the Elite echoes our philosophy on why we only include CFPs which try to cover travel costs [[read it](http://www.cassandrahl.com/blog/why-i-dont-pay-to-speak/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Why%20I%20Don%E2%80%99t%20Pay%20to%20Speak%20by%20%40Tweet_Cassandra%20http%3A//www.cassandrahl.com/blog/why-i-dont-pay-to-speak/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)].

We love that [@jennyshen](http://twitter.com/jennyshen) shared how she went from meetup speaker to conference speaker - in a month! Some helpful points around setting goals, getting feedback and... being brave [[read it](https://medium.com/women-talk-design/i-set-a-goal-to-speak-at-1-conference-by-end-of-2017-heres-how-i-overachieved-it-by-4x-4ca4e77935e7)][tweet it].
