# Edition 145

**This is the last Technically Speaking. There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. We wish you all the best on stage - and off - in 2018!**

**Whilst Technically Speaking is coming to an end, we still plan to be on the internet and continuing to share about public speaking, tech, inclusion - and other - topics.**

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote up her 2017 in speaking and set some goals for 2018 [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/12/19/2017-in-speaking-and-2018-speaking-goals/)][tweet it]. One of them was to "try something new", which seems like a poor goal in it's vagueness... but actually worked out really well.

[@fox](http://twitter.com/fox) wrote up some ideas on how to be proactively inclusive [[read it](https://medium.com/@fox/inclusion-has-to-be-proactive-b01a37f85148)][tweet it] - because saying "the CfP was open to everyone" isn't enough. We concurr!
