# Edition 145

**This is the last Technically Speaking. There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. We wish you all the best on stage - and off - in 2018!**

**Whilst Technically Speaking is coming to an end, we still plan to be on the internet and continuing to share about public speaking, tech, inclusion - and other - topics.**

This week we have proactive inclusion, 2018 speaking goals, and the value of newbies!

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from Cork and Colorado - we are both "home".

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote up her 2017 in speaking and set some goals for 2018 [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/12/19/2017-in-speaking-and-2018-speaking-goals/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=2017%20in%20speaking%20%26%202018%20speaking%20goals%20by%20%40catehstn%20https%3A//cate.blog/2017/12/19/2017-in-speaking-and-2018-speaking-goals/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. One of them was to "try something new", which seems like a poor goal in it's vagueness... but actually worked out really well.

[@fox](http://twitter.com/fox) wrote up some ideas on how to be proactively inclusive [[read it](https://medium.com/@fox/inclusion-has-to-be-proactive-b01a37f85148)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Inclusion%20has%20to%20be%20proactive%20by%20%40fox%20https%3A//medium.com/%40fox/inclusion-has-to-be-proactive-b01a37f85148%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)] - because saying "the CfP was open to everyone" isn't enough. We concur!

We love this from [@coderbyheart](http://twitter.com/coderbyheart) on how newbies bring value [[read it](https://coderbyheart.com/bring-your-inexperience-to-a-conference/)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Bring%20your%20inexperience%20to%20a%20conferenc%20by%20%40coderbyheart%20https%3A//coderbyheart.com/bring-your-inexperience-to-a-conference/%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. "How? questions are making us better teachers. Why? questions are making us more effective."

Super helpful writeup of running a miniconf or a track from [@glasnt](http://twitter.com/glasnt) [[read it](http://glasnt.com/blog/2017/11/20/on-miniconfs-and-specialist-tracks.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=On%20Miniconfs%20and%20Specialist%20Tracks%20by%20%40glasnt%20http%3A//glasnt.com/blog/2017/11/20/on-miniconfs-and-specialist-tracks.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. Much less intimidating than running an entire conference!

Awesome series on speaking preparation from [@juliaferraioli](http://twitter.com/juliaferraioli) ending with this one on the speaking itself [[read it](https://blog.juliaferraioli.com/2017/10/preparing-talk-presenting.html)][[tweet it](https://twitter.com/home?status=Preparing%20a%20talk%3A%20presenting%20by%20%40juliaferraioli%20https%3A//blog.juliaferraioli.com/2017/10/preparing-talk-presenting.html%20via%20%40techspeakdigest)]. The tech and Q&A tips are great, as is this gem, "I remind myself that no one can tell me to shut up during my talk and that tends to calm me down."

## Inspiration

Cate: When I decided I should start speaking, Chiu-Ki was the person I asked for advice. I got advice, sure, but mainly I got a whole lot of encouragement and orders to submit to various CfPs. Over the past three years of doing this project together, I've learned a lot from Chiu-Ki, like how to [deliberately set speaking goals and go after them](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/10/how-i-prepared-my-keynote.html). Or how to stage a secret takeover and [make a conference *you don't even run* more diverse](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/08/droidcon-nyc-22-percent-female-speakers.html). And I've been inspired by her relentless encouragement of other people to get on stage. No-one believes "you have something to say" more than Chiu-Ki. I'm really grateful to have been her partner in sharing that message with y'all.   

Chiu-Ki: It's been 3 years since Cate and I [started Technically Speaking from the Øredev hotel lobby](http://blog.sqisland.com/2014/11/oredev.html), and what a blast! I learned how to get things done by having a rigorous [schedule](https://cate.blog/2014/04/25/5-strategies-for-making-progress-on-side-projects/), applying to other projects such as [Android Dialogs](https://www.youtube.com/AndroidDialogs). I am really inspired by her courage to take a stand and speak up on difficult issues, and I am so thankful to work with her on Technically Speaking, to
[curate a vision of the tech industry that we wish we saw](https://x.design.blog/2017/05/04/the-not-so-secret-feminist-agenda/).
