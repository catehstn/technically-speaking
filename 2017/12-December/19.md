# Edition 145

**This is the last Technically Speaking. There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. We wish you all the best on stage - and off - in 2018!**


This week we have `what`

Thanks to this week's sponsor [@TravisCI](http://twitter.com/travisci)! Focus on writing code. Let Travis CI take care of running your tests and deploying your apps.

This week Technically Speaking comes to you from `where`

Our upcoming talks: Cate is speaking at [@pragmamarkorg](http://twitter.com/pragmamarkorg) October, and [@tryswiftindia](http://twitter.com/tryswiftindia) in November.

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote up her 2017 in speaking and set some goals for 2018 [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/12/19/2017-in-speaking-and-2018-speaking-goals/)][tweet it]. One of them was to "try something new", which seems like a poor goal in it's vagueness... but actually worked out really well.
