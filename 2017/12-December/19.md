# Edition 145

**This is the last Technically Speaking. There will be no Technically Speaking in 2018 - we're taking a break and then re-evaluating what comes next. Cate wrote more about that [here](https://cate.blog/2017/11/02/no-technically-speaking-in-2018/). We want to thank all our sponsors - and especially our sustaining sponsors - but most of all, you. We wish you all the best on stage - and off - in 2018!**

**Whilst Technically Speaking is coming to an end, we still plan to be on the internet and continuing to share about public speaking, tech, inclusion - and other - topics.**

## Link Roundup

Cate wrote up her 2017 in speaking and set some goals for 2018 [[read it](https://cate.blog/2017/12/19/2017-in-speaking-and-2018-speaking-goals/)][tweet it]. One of them was to "try something new", which seems like a poor goal in it's vagueness... but actually worked out really well.

[@fox](http://twitter.com/fox) wrote up some ideas on how to be proactively inclusive [[read it](https://medium.com/@fox/inclusion-has-to-be-proactive-b01a37f85148)][tweet it] - because saying "the CfP was open to everyone" isn't enough. We concurr!

We love this from [@coderbyheart](http://twitter.com/coderbyheart) on how newbies bring value [[read it](https://coderbyheart.com/bring-your-inexperience-to-a-conference/)][tweet it]. "How? questions are making us better teachers. Why? questions are making us more effective."

Super helpful writeup of running a miniconf or a track from [@glasnt](http://twitter.com/glasnt) [[read it](http://glasnt.com/blog/2017/11/20/on-miniconfs-and-specialist-tracks.html)][tweet it]. Much less intimidating than running an entire conference!

## Inspiration

Cate: When I decided I should start speaking, Chiu-Ki was the person I asked for advice. I got advice, sure, but mainly I got a whole lot of encouragement and orders to submit to various CfPs. Over the past three years of doing this project together, I've learned a lot from Chiu-Ki, like how to [deliberately set speaking goals and go after them](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/10/how-i-prepared-my-keynote.html). Or how to stage a secret takeover and [make a conference *you don't even run* more diverse](http://blog.sqisland.com/2015/08/droidcon-nyc-22-percent-female-speakers.html). And I've been inspired by her relentless encouragement of other people to get on stage. No-one believes "you have something to say" more than Chiu-Ki. I'm really grateful to have been her partner in sharing that message with y'all.
